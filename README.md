# MalariaResistanceGenomics
Step 1: Problem Definition  Goal: Identify genetic mutations in Plasmodium falciparum linked to artemisinin resistance.  Why: Artemisinin is the frontline malaria drug; resistance threatens Africa’s malaria control efforts.  Impact: A dashboard showing hotspots of known resistance markers in African isolates → useful for public health/research.
